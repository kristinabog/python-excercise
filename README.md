## Python excercise - Watercolor paint art

This is a python excercise with instructions followed from Code Institute's Full Stack Software Development course.
I chose a different theme and customized it in my own way. I added different content and images than the original excercise.

Technologies used: HTML, CSS, JS, Python, Flask, JSON
