## Python Excercise - Watercolor Paint Art

This is an excercise to become familiar with using Python, Flask and JSON. 
Followed instructions from Code Institute's Full Stack Software Development course.
I customized it in my own way and I added different content and images than the original excercise.

Languages & Technologies used: HTML, CSS, JS, Python, Flask, JSON
